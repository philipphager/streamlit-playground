# ðŸš€ Getting Started with Streamlit

## Install

1. Install [PyCharm Community](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/)
2. Download this repository using e.g., [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to a local folder.
3. Open PyCharm and click `New Project`. As location select this repository you just downloaded. Make sure you create a `New environment using: Virtualenv`. Click `Create` and select `Create from Existing Sources` when prompted.
4. After loading the project on PyCharm, we need to install all dependencies. For that, click on the `Terminal` button at the bottom of Pycharm and open a new Terminal window. Then enter: `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all other Python packages we need for this project. This step might take a few minutes...
5. Lastly, you can run streamlit by entering: `streamlit run main.py` inside the same Terminal window and your browser should open a new website!
